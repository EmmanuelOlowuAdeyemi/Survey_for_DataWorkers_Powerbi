<h2>Cleaning and Transformation:</h2>
<p>First, cleaning and transformation had to be done on PowerBi. In order to present a workable dataset, I dealt with the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Null values</li>
    <li>Duplicate rows</li>
    <li>Renamed Column</li>
</ol>
<p>The cleaned dataset was also done in Power Bi for transformation.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Split Column by Delimiter</li>
    <li>Sorting Column “Which Title Best Fit your Role”,” What Industry do you work in” and” Favorite Programming Language”.</li>
</ol>
